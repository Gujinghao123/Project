This project tries to do regression models on the Project CodeNet Dataset.
There are 2 datasets used in these codes:
1. 'alll.csv' can be downloaded in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hz2SaII_a3GcVINDjZbK47cZ-t5WCboI/view?usp=drive_link
2. 'Java benchmark' can be downloaded in https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/project-codenet/

The 'regression on whole dataset and different languages' codes are used to test different regression models on the whole dataset and on four different languages.

The 'hyperparameter optimization' codes are used to improve model performance through hyperparameter optimization.

The 'segmented regression' codes are used to test the performance of segmented regression on different languages.

The 'word to vector' codes are used to include code content as part of the independent variables.
